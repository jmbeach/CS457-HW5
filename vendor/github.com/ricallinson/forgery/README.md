# Forgery

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ricallinson/forgery.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ricallinson/forgery)

__STABLE VERSION 1.0__: Version 2.x is in development here [forgery2](https://github.com/goforgery/forgery2)

Forgery is a minimal and flexible golang web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, web applications.

    package main

    import(
        "github.com/ricallinson/forgery"
    )

    func init() {
        app := f.CreateServer()
        app.Get("/", func(req *f.Request, res *f.Response, next func()) {
            res.Send("Hello world.")
        })
        app.Listen(3000)
    }
